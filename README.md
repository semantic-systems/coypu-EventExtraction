# coypu-EventExtraction
Event Extraction module for deployment.

This repo contains both the event type detection and event argument extraction modules for inference. Currently, for the first two MVPs, these two modules are independently implemented, meaning it is error pruned - event type and arguments could be mismatched. 
The plan is to merge this two modules into one in the last MVP.

- [ ] MVP 1
- [ ] MVP 2
- [ ] MVP 3
